## S3 Buckets

In Amazon S3, a bucket is a container for storing objects. All objects are stored in a bucket, and each bucket has a unique name that is used to identify it. Bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts, and they must follow certain naming rules, such as being between 3 and 63 characters long and containing only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

You can create, delete, and manage buckets using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs. You can also configure bucket-level settings, such as access control, versioning, and lifecycle policies, to manage the objects stored in the bucket.
