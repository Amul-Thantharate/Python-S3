### Import Libraries ###

1. Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python.
2. The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.

## client And KEY ####

1. We import the boto3 package, which is the AWS SDK for Python.
2. We set up the credentials for the AWS S3 service.
3. We create a client object for the AWS S3 service.

## Create Bucket ###

1. The try block will try to create a new bucket with the given name and region.
2. If the bucket already exists, it will print a message to the user and return the bucket object.
3. If the bucket does not exist, it will create a new bucket with the given name and region, and print a message to the user.

1. We are using the list_buckets function from the client object.
2. We are looping through the response and printing the name of each bucket.
3. If there is an exception, we are printing that out.

2. We are checking if the bucket exists or not.
3. If the bucket exists we are returning the bucket name.

2. We try to upload the file using the upload_file function of the s3 resource. If the file is uploaded successfully, it will print File uploaded successfully.
3. If the file already exists in the bucket, it will print File already exists with the same name ðŸ˜’
4. If there is any other error while uploading the file, it will print the error message and return None.

## Runnung the code ### 

1. We import the boto3 library to use its S3 service.
2. We import the botocore library to handle the exceptions.
3. We create the create_bucket() function to create a bucket.
4. We create the list_buckets() function to list all the buckets.
5. We create the select_bucket() function to select a bucket.
6. We create the upload_file() function to upload a file to a bucket.
7. We create the main() function to run the program.
8. We call the main() function to run the program.
